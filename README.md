Welcome to the Serverless Lambda Boilerplate! This project is designed to streamline the development of serverless applications using AWS Lambda and Prisma. It's built with TypeScript and includes setup for local development and deployment scripts to get you started quickly.

## Features

- **Serverless Framework**: Configure and deploy AWS Lambda functions easily.
- **Prisma ORM**: Robust database management and schema migration support.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed codebase for reliability and maintainability.
- **Local Development**: Local server simulation for easy development and testing.

## Structure Overview

Here's a brief overview of the main components of this boilerplate:

- `src/api/users`: Contains user-related controllers, services, and validators.
- `src/core`: Core functionalities including middleware and HTTP models.
- `src/prisma`: Prisma service and schema for ORM.
- `_templates`: Hygen templates for quickly generating new modules.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Serverless CLI (`npm install -g serverless`)

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MateoCerquetella/serverless-lambda-boilerplate.git
cd serverless-lambda-boilerplate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Setup environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and update it with your environment-specific details:

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN_1="http://localhost:3000"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key"
REGION="your-aws-region"
```

Generate Prisma client:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

### Prisma Migrations

Prisma Migrations allow you to reliably evolve your database schema with ease. These migrations are version-controlled schema changes, which can be applied in a staging or production environment in a predictable way.

#### Initial Setup and First Migration

To set up your database and create your first migration, follow these steps:

1. **Set Database URL**: Ensure that your `.env` file contains the correct `DATABASE_URL`. This URL should point to your database, where Prisma will manage the schema migrations.

   Example `.env` entry:

   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydb"
   ```

2. **Create the First Migration**: Run the following command to create your first migration. The migration will include the initial schema setup based on your current Prisma schema.

   ```bash
   npm run prisma:migration:new -- --name first_migration
   ```

   This command will generate SQL migration files within the `prisma/migrations` directory, which describe the steps necessary to reach your desired schema state.

#### Applying Migrations

To apply migrations to your database:

```bash
npm run prisma:migration:deploy
```

This command will apply all pending migrations in the order they were created to the database specified in your `DATABASE_URL`. It's a safe way to update your database schema as part of your deployment process.

#### Creating Subsequent Migrations

Whenever you make changes to your Prisma schema file (`schema.prisma`), you will need to generate a new migration. These migrations capture incremental changes to your database schema.

To create a new migration after updating your schema:

```bash
npm run prisma:migration:new -- --name descriptive_migration_name
```

This will generate a new set of migration files reflecting changes since the last migration, ensuring that your schema changes are version-controlled and deployable.

### Running Locally

To start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Serverless Offline plugin, simulating AWS Lambda and API Gateway on your local machine.

## Deployment

To deploy your application to AWS:

```bash
npm run deploy:dev
```

This script will set up your environment, generate the necessary Prisma client, and deploy your application to AWS using the development stage configuration.

## Creating New Modules

This boilerplate comes equipped with a module generator script that makes it easy to scaffold new modules quickly and consistently. Each module includes a set of predefined files such as controllers, services, validators, and handler setups, tailored for serverless applications.

### How to Use the Module Generator

To create a new module, you can use the `generate:module` script included in the `package.json`. This script automates the creation of necessary files and configurations for a new module, following the defined templates in the `_templates` directory.

Hereâ€™s how to generate a new module named "People":

```bash
npm run generate:module -- --name people --route people
```

### What Happens When You Generate a Module?

When you run the `generate:module` command, the following will happen:

1. **Module Directory**: A new directory under `src/api` will be created with the name you specified.
2. **Files Created**:
   - A new `controller.ts` for managing request handling.
   - A `service.ts` for business logic associated with the module.
   - A `validator.ts` for input validation.
   - Handler files within a `handlers` subdirectory for different operations like create, read, update, and delete.
   - A `functions.yml` file for defining serverless functions specific to this module.
3. **Routing Setup**: The route you specify will be used to configure the endpoints in your serverless setup.

### Customizing Your Module

You can customize the templates used for module generation by modifying the EJS templates located in the `_templates/module/new` directory. These templates define the structure and content of the files that are generated for each new module.

By adjusting these templates, you can ensure that every new module conforms to your project's coding standards and architectural decisions.

### Integrating the New Module

After generating a new module, don't forget to integrate it into your main application setup. This includes:

- Adding any new dependencies required by the module.
- Ensuring that the new serverless functions defined in the `functions.yml` of the module are correctly referenced in the main `serverless.yml`.
- Registering any new routes and handlers in your application's routing and serverless configuration.

This process ensures that your new module is fully functional and ready to be developed further or deployed as part of your application.
